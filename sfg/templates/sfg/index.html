					<p><em>"Working with Nu Chapter gave us an incredible level of clarity in terms of product development. They went well beyond the initial scope of the project and addressed not only what features in the app would increase engagement and lead to monetization, but which potential features would make users want to share the app with friends, and categorized their thinking in terms of novelty, social currency and game mechanics. They backed their theories with pertinent data and gave us a very clear set of objectives moving forward, which we needed. Working with Nu Chapter was particularly beneficial for us, because their team clearly understands the future of consumer facing technology as well as, if not better than some senior level executives."</em></p>
